The Argentinian star, who won the World Cup with his country last year, will be joining David Beckham\u2019s Florida club in a move that has been met with surprise by many.\\n\\nThe 35-year-old had been linked with a return to Barcelona, the club where he emerged as one of the greatest players of all time, but Messi explained why an emotional return did not materialise.\\n\\n\u201cIf the Barcelona thing didn\u2019t work out, I wanted to leave Europe, get out of the spotlight and think more about my family,\u201d he said. \u201cI really wanted, I was very excited to be able to return [to Barcelona], but after having experienced what I experienced and the exit I had, I did not want to be in the same situation again \u2013 waiting to see what was going to happen.\u201d\\n\\nMessi\u2019s decision to cross the Atlantic is somewhat of a surprise. Many believed he would follow in the footsteps of his old rival Cristiano Ronaldo and sign a lucrative deal with a club in Saudi Arabia. Others thought he would rejoin Barcelona, the club where he emerged as one of the greatest players of all time.\\n\\nInter Miami would be a dubious landing spot for Lionel MessiRead more\\n\\nThe Athletic reported on Tuesday that MLS has offered the Argentinian a revenue-sharing deal with Adidas and Apple TV+, which broadcasts the league in the US. There have also been reports that Messi, like Beckham, will be offered the chance to own an MLS team when he retires.\\n\\nMessi is joining a club in flux. Inter Miami are bottom of MLS\u2019s Eastern Conference and fired their manager Phil Neville last week. They still do not have a permanent home in the city, and play at a temporary 18,000-capacity stadium in Fort Lauderdale. The team were also disciplined by MLS in 2021 for violating the league\u2019s roster rules.\\n\\nHowever, fortunes can turn around quickly in MLS, a competition that is designed to have more parity than the European leagues Messi is used to. Inter Miami are six points adrift of ninth place, where they would qualify for an elimination game to make the end\u2011of\u2011season playoffs.\\n\\nThe move also represents a publicity coup for MLS as it continues its push to become a major player in US sports. The last time the league attracted a player of Messi\u2019s fame was when Beckham joined Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007.\\n\\nMessi\u2019s contract with Paris Saint\u2011Germain expires on 30 June and the club have confirmed he will not sign a new deal to stay in France. While a return to Barcelona would have been a sentimental choice for the 35-year-old, the club\u2019s precarious financial position all but ruled out a reunion.\\n\\nThe news of Messi\u2019s move to Inter Miami has been met with excitement by fans of the club, and of MLS in general. It is a move that could potentially transform the fortunes of the club, and of the league as a whole. It remains to be seen how Messi will fare in his new surroundings, but one thing is for sure \u2013 the eyes of the footballing world will be firmly fixed on Inter Miami.      </div>\\n    <section style=\\\"padding-top: 48px;
